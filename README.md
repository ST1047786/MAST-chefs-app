📖**Overview**

ChefMenu is a cross-platform mobile application designed for Chef Christoffel, a private chef who offers unique, personalized dining experiences.
The app enables the chef to create, update, and manage daily menus easily, giving clients real-time access to the latest culinary offerings.

Each evening brings a new dining experience, so flexibility and ease of use were essential. ChefMenu provides a simple yet elegant solution — allowing quick editing, viewing, and organization of dishes right from the chef’s device.

🎯 **Project Purpose**

This project was developed as part of the Portfolio of Evidence (Part 2) for the Mobile Application Development module.
The goal was to design and implement a fully functional user interface using React Native and TypeScript, incorporating interactivity, responsive design, and real-time updates.

The app showcases:

Proficiency in React Native development

Effective use of state management and validation logic

Practical application of mobile UX principles

Professional-level documentation and design consistency

🌟**Features**

ChefMenu includes all the core functionality required by the project brief:

👨‍🍳 **Menu Management**

Add dishes with name, description, course type, and price.

Choose from predefined courses (Starters, Mains, Desserts, Wine Pairing).

Remove items easily when they are no longer part of the menu.

📋 **Real-Time Menu Display**

Displays all dishes dynamically as they are added.

Automatically updates the total number of items available.

Provides a clear, organized view for both chef and clients.


📱 **User Flow**

Launch the app → Home screen opens automatically.

Fill in the form to add a new dish.

Select the appropriate course.

Enter price and description.

Press Add Menu Item → dish appears in the menu list.

The total item count updates automatically.

To remove a dish, tap Remove next to the item.

This flow ensures speed, clarity, and efficiency — allowing the chef to focus on cooking rather than admin.
